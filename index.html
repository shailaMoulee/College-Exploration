        <p class="nyuInfo">New York University has been my dream school ever since I was 4 years old. Upon immigrating to the United States, I began my American educational jourey at PS.69Q Elementary School where my kindergarten teacher, Ms. D'Angelo, rekindled my love for education. She taught me how to pick up a pencil and instilled in me, self-confidence and self-determination. I still remember Ms. D'Angelo, on the last day of school, telling my peers and I that her daughter was accepted into NYU. At that time, I was not aware of the prestidge that is tied into being admitted to NYU, but I knew that it was something that made my teacher happy. And since Ms. D'Angelo was the reason behind my happiness in school, I thought working hard would allow her to indulge in its warmth. Fast forward to middle school, I began researching about NYU and its large scale of departments and fields. I was personally drawn to the university's mission to thrive <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about.html#:~:text=NYU%20Mission%20Statement&text=Its%20students%2C%20faculty%20and%20alumni,and%20excelling%20in%20demanding%20professions." target="_blank" style="color:#8B139C;font-weight:bold;">"beyond borders and across academic disciplines."</a> And all throughout High School, I have invested time and effort into branding myself as an individual within whom is enfolded the entire universe. NYU, once a dream, is now a reality comprised of patience, dedication, and hard work.</p><br>

        <p class="cuInfo">Columbia University is an institution that shares the morals, ambitions, and standards that I set for myself. I was first introduced to Columbia when I was in Elementary School. My father, having worked as a Yellow Cab driver, often dropped off students at the university campus. He once shared a dialogue with a student who drew parallels between our stories of immigrating to the United States and having to restart everything for the sake of a good life. She spoke highly of her father who also drove for a living upon moving to NYC and how she was working hard to ensure a good future for not herself, but also her family. My dad finds great importance in education, especially that of women. And he works through sleepless nights to ensure that his three daughters would one day be educated enough to stand atop their own two feet. I would like to attend Columbia because it is known to <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/content/admissions" target="_blank" style="color:#4a85c8;font-weight:bold;">"attract and engage the best minds in pursuit of greater human understanding, pioneering new discoveries, and service to society."</a> The Columbia landscape seems the most fitting for my curiosity-driven self. And it is the most inviting for students, like myself, who wish to seek an immersive experience that defies the traditional parameters of education.</p><br>

        <p class="hcInfo">Hunter College has been my absolute top choice in the realms of CUNY. I have spoken with a lot of Hunter College alumni to gain insight of the pre and post admission experiences. My teachers and family have also encouraged me to look into this institution and to consider its potential impact on my educational journey. I must admit, Hunter College remains the most attractive in its offerings of academic programs that <a href="https://hunter.cuny.edu/about/mission/" target="_blank" style="color:#5f259f;font-weight:bold;">"stress the significance of human diversity, emphasize research and artistic creation, and invite students to extend their education beyond campus."</a> Attending this college would allow me to network with its prominent faculty members and engage in unparalleled coursework. More importantly, I would be on the receiving end of a high-quality and affordable education as per the institutional standards of financial aid and low tuition. Hunter College would also grant me an opportunity, as a proud New Yorker, to enjoy the amenities of city life. I am confident in the said institution's ability to satisfy both my personal and academic needs.</p>
